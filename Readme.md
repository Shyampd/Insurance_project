age: Age of the insured

sex: Gender of the insured

bmi: Body Mass Index

children: Number of children covered

smoker: Smoking status

region: Residential region

charges: Individual medical costs billed

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked dataset shape, null values, and summary statistics

Distribution analysis of numerical and categorical features

Visualized relationships using Seaborn & Matplotlib

Correlation heatmap of numerical variables
